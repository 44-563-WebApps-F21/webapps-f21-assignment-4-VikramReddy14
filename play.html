        THIRD ACT


        SCENE


        _The Library in Lord Goring’s house_. _An Adam room_. _On the right is
        the door leading into the hall_. _On the left_, _the door of the
        smoking-room_. _A pair of folding doors at the back open into the
        drawing-room_. _The fire is lit_. _Phipps_, _the butler_, _is arranging
        some newspapers on the writing-table_. _The distinction of Phipps is his
        impassivity_. _He has been termed by enthusiasts the Ideal Butler_. _The
        Sphinx is not so incommunicable_. _He is a mask with a manner_. _Of his
        intellectual or emotional life_, _history knows nothing_. _He represents
        the dominance of form_.

    </h4>
    
       <h6>LORD GORING.</h6> <p>[_Slowly_.]</p> <p>Yes; most men would call it ugly names. There
        is no doubt of that.</p>

        <h6>SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h6><p> [_Bitterly_.]</p> <p>Men who every day do something of
        the same kind themselves. Men who, each one of them, have worse secrets
        in their own lives.</p>

        <h6>LORD GORING.</h6> <p>That is the reason they are so pleased to find out other
        people’s secrets. It distracts public attention from their own.</p>

        <h6>SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h6> <p>And, after all, whom did I wrong by what I did? No
        one.</p>

        <h6>LORD GORING.</h6> <p>[_Looking at him steadily_.] </p> <p>Except yourself, Robert.</p>

        <h6>SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h6> <p>[_After a pause_.]</p> <p>Of course I had private
        information about a certain transaction contemplated by the Government of
        the day, and I acted on it. Private information is practically the
        source of every large modern fortune.</p>

        <h6>LORD GORING.</h6> <p>[_Tapping his boot with his cane_.]</p> <p>And public scandal
        invariably the result.</p>

        <h6>SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h6> <p>[_Pacing up and down the room_.]</p> <p>Arthur, do you
        think that what I did nearly eighteen years ago should be brought up
        against me now? Do you think it fair that a man’s whole career should be
        ruined for a fault done in one’s boyhood almost? I was twenty-two at the
        time, and I had the double misfortune of being well-born and poor, two
        unforgiveable things nowadays. Is it fair that the folly, the sin of
        one’s youth, if men choose to call it a sin, should wreck a life like
        mine, should place me in the pillory, should shatter all that I have
        worked for, all that I have built up. Is it fair, Arthur?</p>

        <h6>LORD GORING.</h6><p> Life is never fair, Robert. And perhaps it is a good thing
        for most of us that it is not.</p>

        <h6>SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h6> <p>Every man of ambition has to fight his century with
        its own weapons. What this century worships is wealth. The God of this
        century is wealth. To succeed one must have wealth. At all costs one
        must have wealth.</p>

        <h6>LORD GORING.</h6> <p>You underrate yourself, Robert. Believe me, without wealth
        you could have succeeded just as well.</p>

        <h6>SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h6><p> When I was old, perhaps. When I had lost my
        passion for power, or could not use it. When I was tired, worn out,
        disappointed. I wanted my success when I was young. Youth is the time
        for success. I couldn’t wait.</p>

        <h6>LORD GORING.</h6><p> Well, you certainly have had your success while you are
        still young. No one in our day has had such a brilliant success.
        Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs at the age of forty—that’s good
        enough for any one, I should think.</p>

        <h6>SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h6><p> And if it is all taken away from me now? If I lose
        everything over a horrible scandal? If I am hounded from public life?</p>

        <h6>LORD GORING.</h6> <p>Robert, how could you have sold yourself for money?</p>

        <h6>SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h6> <p>[_Excitedly_.]</p> <p>I did not sell myself for money. I
        bought success at a great price. That is all.</p>

<h6>LORD GORING.</h6> <p>[_Gravely_.]</p> <p>Yes; you certainly paid a great price for it.
        But what first made you think of doing such a thing?</p>

       <h6>SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h6> <p>Baron Arnheim.</p>

        <h6>LORD GORING.</h6> <p>Damned scoundrel!</p>
